# Password-Generator-App


## Instructions:

The challenge is to Generate a password when the button is clicked
  * Present a series of prompts for password criteria
    * Length of password
      * At least 8 characters but no more than 128.
    * Character types
      * Lowercase
      * Uppercase
      * Numeric
      * Special characters ($@%&*, etc)
  * Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected
  * Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page. 

  I have however chosen to display the password to the page.
